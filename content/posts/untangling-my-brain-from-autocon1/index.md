Last week I had some fun in Amsterdam, and at no point was there any debauchery.

For those who are unaware, Autocon is a conference put together by the Network Automation Forum. Autocon1 was the second event ever, and the first in Europe. They ran autocon0 in Denver in the Autumn of 2023.

TL:DR - if you are in the network automation space, you have to try and get yourself there. It's a _very_ valuable event.
