Starting yesterday I began to deploy our Nexus 9000 ACI solution into our Datacentre. Scary yet fun times are ahead.

Over the course of the project I will do my best to chronicle anonymised info that talks about what we did and how we did it.  Some of that may be of use to another ACI hopeful, whereas some will be pretty specific to my environment.  One thing I won't be doing is reinventing the blogging wheel, and I will chose to refer to others that helped me, rather than rehash the same subjects over and over again.

Enjoy (or not, wotevs)
