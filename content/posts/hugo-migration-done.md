Weird. In my first hugo post just two days ago I speculated it would take me weeks to get this content off blogger and into hugo.

It took me three evenings.

All the DNS has been switched and we are now fully on hugo with a gitops workflow, previews on a branch push and I was even able to retain the old URL paths as an alias, so anyone googling my stupid opinions can still read them on the new or the old path. Noice.

Now its this easy to write posts, I expect I will still be crap at doing that, but who knows, maybe I will improve.

Time will tell.

Until next time. Whenever that is!
