Last week I had some fun in Amsterdam, and at no point was there any debauchery.

For those who are unaware, Autocon is a conference put together by the Network Automation Forum. Autocon1 was the second event ever, and the first in Europe. They ran autocon0 in Denver in the Autumn of 2023.

TL:DR - if you are in the network automation space, you have to try and get yourself there. It's a _very_ valuable event.

## Day 1: Setting the scene

I dont think you can actually say that the first day started at any particular point. Registration opened at 8am and we arrived about 9 when there were lots of standing tables with a few folks. Content wasnt due to start until after lunch, and so it was _mingle time_. Nerds are pretty awkward introverts at the best of times, so a lot of this started off as people who knew each other merging into little pods and chatting, and the odd person sort of magnetically attaching quietly to the side of the chat. 

One of the best parts of this is that in such a small subset of an already small subsection of Tech, there was **no** problem finding common ground to talk about. Thoruhgout the morning i made new friends and put faces to a bunch of names that I had only engaged with online. It was really quite nice!

During the Afternoon we started to settle into our conference seats to hear Dinesh Dutt (He of Cisco, Cumulus, and now SuzieQ fame), ask "Why havenâ€™t we seen full adoption of network automation, yet?"

### Dinesh's Keynote

Whilst he says in the opening slides that he is there to disrupt the status quo, i'm not entirely sure that he said anything overly contentious (he did that on Friday tho...)
