👋 Hi. I am John Howard 

💼 By day, I am Head of Network Infrastructure (@protonjhow) for Proton AG, the company behind ProtonMail and ProtonVPN.

🏡 Out of hours, I am a nerd, a dad and a shitposter, commonly found making noise on bluesky (@fatred.bgp4.life). I can usually be found in the packetpushers and NAF slack groups, and the Nokia discord servers @fatred.

👀 I am interested in Practical Network Automation for real networks.

🌱 I am currently learning Go, and have a strong background in Python.

💞️ I am looking to collaborate on anything that supports the Network Engineer in their daily tasks and the business achieving their aims with clean, repeatable automation.

📫 You can reach me at fatred@gmail.com or find me on bluesky @fatred.bgp4.life (ex @fatred on twatter)
